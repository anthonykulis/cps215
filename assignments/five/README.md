# Assignment 5

## Implement Quick Sort
Using the algorithm pseudo-code provided and work completed in class, implement quickSort. The only rule here is to develop your own pivot strategy. I will not teach this in class and you will be required to research it online and implement it in the code.

### Solutions
Since there are many pivot strategies available, the solution may vary.

### Pass/Fail
* To receive the full 25 points, your solution must work iteratively. Extra credit will be given for doing an time analysis on your strategy versus my naive random strategy. This means you will probably want to create a public quickSort that allows the user to test different strategies. To get the extra credit, you will need to submit an analysis. This analysis should show the times required to sort random arrays of a given length. If you reuse the same array over and over, the compiler may (or may not) optimize the solution, giving you incorrect results. You will have to experiment to find out. Submitting a graph of my strategy versus time overlaid with your strategy versus time is satisfactory.

* This will be pass/fail. 25 points if you pass. 0 if you dont. To pass, you must have compilable code that runs correctly. Your unit tests will determine if they do. Unit tests are mandatory like they will be on all assignments.

### Due Date
The due date will be Friday November 4, 2016 at midnight. To be eligible for the assignment extra credit you must meet this deadline.

### Extra Credit
* This extra credit will be slightly different. To be eligible for the 5 points extra credit, your need to provide an analysis of strategy versus time. If more than one person submits the same graph containing the same data, no one submitting that graph will receive extra credit. You must do the analysis on your own. Otherwise, you may work in teams.

* Of course, refactoring may come into play to receive the full 5 points.

### Submitting Code
Use D2L to submit your source files. Please submit them as just java files, not zip files. If there is issue submitting, a Github commit to your repository or email the source to me is fine. Please notify me via email if there is issue.
